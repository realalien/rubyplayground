* processes and rules
sometimes if we have not a clear goal of achievements, we study the world unsupervised, which means the processing of information cannot be confirmed by other counterparts or by other developers, but the knowledge is there and should be materialized!
e.g.
scenario,
  I am asked to buy a piece of real estate, but people at my age has already done that and the price is still on the rise and difficult to afford, I need to find the estate which are under-valued and greater potentials.
process,
  -> collect info.
  -> how to evaluate? e.g. what's your target? seek randomly? create a map of community resources




* idea:  if cities of non-major ones are going to collapse , how to proof the bet on going-to-downgrade communities?
