# Purpose: 
# Design code for modeling a life cycle of a normal/regular human,
# in order to create a tool for assist next generations with help
# from machine. 

# Note :
# * 
# * 20100828, the first thought is to create a state machine code structure
# * 20100828, since a human life can be a very large state machine, it is assumed
#             that from beginning the state machine to achieve small scale of part of life.
# * 20100828, Q: what about a timeline implementation? Maybe useful in presentation and visualization.
